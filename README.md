An application that allows a user to fill out a form on skateboard parts and place their order on the DOM
to keep track of what skateboards they wanted to place an order for.

# Tech Used: HTML, CSS, EJS, Express 
This project took HTML, CSS, EJS, and express to get the desired result. 
# Lessons Learned
This was one of my first exposures to developing on the back end. Alot of valuable debugging came from this
and showed me how to interact with DOM through the server. This was one of my first tries at using CRUD to
create a feature for updating. I also learned alot more about the backend and how to succesfully move through routes.
